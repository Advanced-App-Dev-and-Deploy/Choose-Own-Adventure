## 1-Page Written Story: Developing Computational Thinking through Object, Behavior, & Decision Definitions
- characters
- choices
- what environment looks like (illustrating position)
  - 2D Shapes
  - text
  - images
  - buttons
  - keyboard presses
  - music
  - sound effects, etc.)

## Case Studies: drawing stages or levels for written story
- See Above
- Template type story might be 10 pages
- Non-template might be 3-5 pages

## Prototyping Case Studies in Processing-JAVA
- Static Programming
- Developing Vertices Formulae based on Case Studies

### Variable Example: GUI Design
```JAVA
//Simplified Global Variable Initiation and Declaration
color red = #FF0303, white = #FFFFFF, startingColor = white; //Processing-JAVA Specific
int rectXStart = width*1/4, rectYStart = height*1/4, rectXEnd = width*1/2, rectYEnd = height*1/2;
//
size(600, 400); // Width & Height Key-variables and Geometry
//
fill(red);
rect (rectXStart, rectYStart, rectXEnd, rectYEnd);
fill(startingColor); //restoring default as best practice
```

# To Include

- Developing Variables
  - Geometry Ratios of Display communication through `size()` or `fullScreen()`
  - Best Practice: enter formula on first variable, reference variable for subsequent formulae results in changing formula on one line
- Developing Computational Thinking Flowchart and organization of 'slides and information'
  - Includes data mutation (assignment and arithmetic, HEAP Sheet tracking)
- Review entire code with **Object** Lens
- Leads to MagPie Materials (Object Orientated Programming), <a href">Click Here when Repo Ready</a>
  - Conversation Flowchart
